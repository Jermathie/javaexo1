    /*
        Let us try out one of the most recognizable javascript patterns: the callback function.

        Before we start with we need to talk about synchronicity. Which sounds complicated but don't worry it really isn't.
        A program can either be synchronous or asynchronous.

        A synchronous program will execute all statements one after another and only when the previous command has finished.
        So if you have statements 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' (in that order) then the program will execute them in the order 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'.
        And 'b' will only start once 'a' has been completely executed, etc...

        Asynchronous means that the statements can be executed in a different order than they appear.
        This is because you want two or more statements run at the same time.
        An example: Say you want to start executing 'a' but don't want to wait for the result.
        So everything has to continue immediately after 'a' has started.
        No matter if 'a' will take a few seconds, a few hours or will never finish at all.
        In this case we say that 'a' runs asynchronously.

        A good example is loading an image on a website.
        If downloading an images takes a while you don't want your website to wait on that image to display all the rest of your site.
        No, you start downloading the image in the background, load the rest of the website and whenever the images has been downloaded you show the image.
        Back in the old days this wasn't the case and you could look at a white screen for a few seconds before anything would show.
        Now you get the basic structure of your site almost immediately and all the heavier files (like images) pop up as soon that they have been downloaded.

        Asynchronicity is so popular that Chrome and Firefox only allow asynchronous http-calls.

        Exercise:
        Open the page and look at the console.
        You'll see 'Http call finished' will be displayed after the data has been loaded.
        The 'Before' and 'After' log messages will appear as normal.

    console.log('Before');
    fetch('https://tax-system.herokuapp.com/persons', {
        method: 'GET'
    })
        .then(() => console.log('Http call finished'));
    console.log('After');
