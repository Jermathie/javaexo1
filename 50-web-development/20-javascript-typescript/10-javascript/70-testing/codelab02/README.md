# Exercise 01

Check the `exercise01.spec.js` file, it's a so called spec (or test).
- They contain the tests of the functionality which you will yet have to implement in `exercise01.js`.
- Currently, the tests will fail. When done implementing the required functionality in `exercise01.js`,
    they should all succeed.
