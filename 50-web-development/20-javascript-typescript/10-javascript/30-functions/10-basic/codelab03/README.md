# Exercise02 - Functions

- Write two `'Hello world!'` functions `helloOne()` and `helloTwo()`
- Assign one of them to a variable (`const helloOne = function () {}`)
- Declare the other one as function (`function helloTwo() {}`)
- Try to call both functions at the top of `index.js`

Do you see what happens with functions not assigned to a variable?
