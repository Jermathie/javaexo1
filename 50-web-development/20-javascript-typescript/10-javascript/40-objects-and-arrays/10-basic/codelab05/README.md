# Codelab05 - Objects

- Write a function that accepts an `object` and prints a summary of its properties

For example, for the following object

```javascript
const obj = {
  x: 2,
  y: 5
};
```

`'This object has 2 properties, x and y'`. Make it easy on yourself and use a **template string** (see `Strings` chapter).
