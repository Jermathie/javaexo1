# Codelab02 - Spread operator

In `index.js` we initialize a variable person with some data

- Using the spread operator, initialize a second variable `const address` with all the fields of address and log the result
- After creating the `address` variable, change `address.area.country` of `person` to `BE` and log the separate `address` variable again, what do you see?
- Override the numbers field with `777` when assigning it to `address` by adding another `numbers` field after the spread
