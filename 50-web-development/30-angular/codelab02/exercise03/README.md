## Get the arch enemy for a hero

> A new API endpoint appears! By querying `/api/archEnemies/byHero/{hero_id}` you can fetch the arch enemy for a certain hero.

- Create a new service (arch enemy service for example)
- Try fetching the villain for a hero of your choosing, subscribe to the observable and log the result in the console to see what data you get
- Now create a new arch enemy component that gets a hero id as input and displays the arch enemy information by fetching it from the new service
- Use this new component on the hero detail component
