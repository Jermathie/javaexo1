# Koan day 1

## Code that you'll need
- Code for a main method: `public static void main(String args[]){}`. Write your code within the `{}`.
- Code to print out something 'A message': `System.out.prinln("A message");`
- Code to create a variable: `<variable_type> <variable_name> = <variable_value>;`. (e.g. `int number = 5`)
- Code to create a method: `public <return_type> <method_name>(<parameter_type1> <parameter_name1>, ...){}`. 
Write your code within the `{}`. (e.g. `public int getNegative(int number){ return number*-1;}`)
- Code to return a value from with a method: `return <value>;`
- Code to call a method: `<method_name>(<argument1>, ...);` (e.g. `getNegative(5);`)
`

! **Remember** !: No copy-paste. The point is to get it in your fingers. So write it over.

Don't think about it too much either. Just see it as pieces of a puzzle that you need to put in the right order. 

## Where do I put my code?
Either: 
- on a piece of paper 
- create a new java class for each exercise.
    - right click on `koan01` in your project structure. 
    - select `new`, then `Java Class`
    - type in a name for your new java class (e.g. `Exercise1`)
    - **important** create a new class for each exercise

## Exercise 1
Write a `main` method wherein you print out `hello koans!`.

## Exercise 2
Write a `main` method wherein you make a `boolean` variable named `truthy`.
Give it the value `true`.
Print out `truthy`.

## Exercise 3
Write a `main` method wherein you save the result of `1 + 1` in an `int` variable named `sum`.
Print out `sum`.

## Exercise 4
Write a `main` method wherein you make 3 variables.
- The first variable is a `double` named `bobsMoney` and has value `5.21`.
- The second variable is a `double` named `katiesMoney` and has value `6.32`
- The third variable is a `double` named `totalMoney` and has as a value the sum of `bobsMoney` and `katiesMoney`
Print out `totalMoney`.

## Exercise 5
Write a method that is `public`, returns an `int`, is named `sum`, takes two parameters: an `int` that is named `left` and another `int` that is named `right`.
Let this method return the sum of the parameters `left` and `right`.

Create a `main` method wherein you create an `int` variable name `total`.
Give the variable `total` the value that is the result of calling the `sum` method with arguments `2` and `3`.

Print out `total`.
