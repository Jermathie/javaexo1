# Koan of the day

Coding is not only about insight, but also about having a set of tools that help you solve problems.

Like a carpenter that uses saws, chisels and hammers. You too need to collect your own set of saws, chisels and hammers.

In the beginning this set of tools can feel weird, since you might not totally understand how or why they work. 
A big part of being an apprentice is learning to use tools without really understanding them. 

The goal as an apprentice is to solve problems in a direct way. 
It doesn't matter if you don't understand why it works. 
You get directions from a master, you try it out and you get a result.

By keeping doing these exercises over and over again, you gain more insight.
You start understanding the tools, start seeing the variations, understanding why they work.

Being a master in a profession is understanding your tools thoroughly and seeing the different solutions for a problem, but it comes after a lot of practice.

## Koans
Koans are simple exercises practicing an act that you repeat so often that you don't need to think about it anymore.
The act become second nature to yourself. Like opening a door or reading.

The goal of these koans is getting the syntax of java in your fingers.
When we ask you to create a variable, class or for-loop, it shouldn't require any thought.
The goals is to write it so often that you could write these java constructs in your in sleep.

That's also why we would like you to not copy or let intellij autocomplete the exercises.
Even writing your Koans with pen and paper would be a possibility. 

## Every day
Repetition, repetition, repetition, you need to repeat your Koans every day.
Thats why, starting from the second day, we expect you to write your Koans before the scrum.
Every day.

They shouldn't take more then 10 minutes. 
If you are not finished before the scrum, you still have time during the break between the scrum and the start of the presentations.
